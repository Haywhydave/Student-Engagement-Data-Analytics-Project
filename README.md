## KEY INSIGHTS
1.	Top Customers Drive Growth
A small group of loyal customers significantly contributes to overall sales, showing the importance of building strong retention and loyalty programs.
2.	Balanced Coffee Preferences
Sales distribution among Ara. (26.67%), Rob. (24.73%), Lib. (24.05%), and Exc. (24.56%) shows no single coffee type dominates, indicating a diverse range of customer tastes.
3.	Sales by Country Show Growth Opportunities
Some countries account for higher sales volumes than others, suggesting expansion strategies can target underperforming regions to balance market reach.
4.	Roast Type Influences Sales
Dark roast varieties are consistently preferred, highlighting an opportunity to feature more dark roast options in promotions.
5.	Customer Loyalty Matters
Customers with loyalty cards tend to spend more, suggesting that investing in loyalty rewards can boost repeat purchases and overall sales.
6.	Seasonal or Time-Based Trends
Sales vary across months/years, showing patterns that can help plan promotions during peak and low-demand periods.
7.	Top 10 Customers Highlight Personalization Value
