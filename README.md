# Student-Engagement-Data-Analytics-Project
## Project Objective
- This project examines causes of declining student interest in education. Using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, it analyzes demographic, social, and environmental factors to uncover insights and recommend strategies to improve student motivation and performance.

## Data Set link Used
[Dataset](https://github.com/Haywhydave/Student-Engagement-Data-Analytics-Project/blob/main/educational_research_questionnaire_responses.xlsx)
[Final Dataset](https://github.com/Haywhydave/Student-Engagement-Data-Analytics-Project/blob/main/educational_research_questionnaire_responses.csv)
## Questions (KPIs)
1.	What are the main factors contributing to the decline in students’ interest in education?
2. How do demographic variables (age, gender, education level) influence student motivation and academic performance?
3. What is the relationship between learning environments (teaching style, facilities, peer influence) and student engagement?
4. To what extent do personal and external challenges (financial stress, lack of resources, mental health) affect study habits and motivation?
5. What strategies or interventions do students believe would improve their interest and performance in education?

- Power BI (Visualization and Insights)

# Methodology and Data Collection
## Data Source
A structured Google Survey Form was designed and the link was shared online among students across various educational levels. The questionnaire covered demographic information, study habits, financial challenges, learning preferences, mentorship, and mental health.

## Survey Instrument
The questionnaire was designed to capture responses across six key domains:

- Demographics: Age, Gender, Education Level (for segmentation).
- Academic Outcome: Current Academic Grade, Study Hours (as dependent variables).
- Learning Environment: Likert scale questions on teaching clarity, peer support, and resource adequacy.
- Personal/External Challenges: Scales for financial stress, mental health impact, and access to resources.
- Motivation: Core question on general interest level (Scale: 1-5).
- Interventions: Questions on desired mentorship, use of stress services, and open-ended feedback.

## Data Collection
- Target Audience: Students across High School, Undergraduate, and Graduate levels.
- Distribution Method: Distributed via social media student groups, whatsapp status and through personal messaging on whatsapp
- Sample Size (n): 41responses
- Collection Period: October 1, 2025 to October 2, 2025

## Deliverables
- Data File: Cleaned dataset in CSV format
- SQL Queries: Containing all analytical computations
- Power BI Dashboard: Interactive visual analysis
- Documentation Report: Full report with methodology, findings, and recommendations


## Conclusion
This project provides a data-driven understanding of the factors influencing students’ declining interest in education. The insights reveal that while students are clear about their career goals, challenges such as limited financial support, poor mentorship access, mental health struggles, and weak parental engagement hinder motivation and performance. By implementing the recommended interventions including mentorship programs, hybrid learning models, and improved financial and emotional support educational institutions can foster a more engaging, supportive, and inclusive learning environment.
